\description{
plotting raw scores or APC-I model results
}
\usage{
apci.plot(model, age, period, outcome_var,
type = "model", quantile = NULL, ...)
}
%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.
\arguments{
  \item{model}{
A list, inheriting the corresponding results generated by function apci.
}
  \item{outcome_var}{
An object of class character representing the name of the outcome variable used in APC-I model. The outcome variable itself can be numerical and categorical.
}
  \item{age}{
An object of class character representing the age group index taking on a small number of distinct values in the data. Usually, the vector should be converted to a factor (or the terms of "category" and "enumerated type").
}
  \item{period}{
An object of class character, similar to the argument of age, representing the time period index in the data.
}
  \item{type}{
Character, "explore" or "model". If type is "explore", plots for age and period raw scores will be generated. If type is "model", model results will be plotted. The default setting is "model".
}
  \item{quantile}{
A number between 0 and 1, representing the percentiles to be used in visualizing the data or model. If NULL, the original magnitude will be used.
